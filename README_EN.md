## SDK Integration Guide

Before using the Bingo tool, you need to integrate [PlayableSDK.d.ts](./PlayableSDK.d.ts) into your project. This SDK provides the following two main interfaces:

1. `download()` - Call this method when the user clicks the download button
2. `game_end()` - Must be called when the game ends (whether win or lose)

Sample usage:

```typescript
try {
    PlayableSDK.download(); // Download button click event
    PlayableSDK.game_end(); // Call when the game ends
} catch (error) {
    console.warn(error);
}
```

## What Problems Does It Solve for You?

1. Tedious platform adaptation - Different ad platforms have different SDK requirements, Bingo has built-in all adaptation code for you
2. Complex build process - From the original project to the final ad package, just a few clicks
3. Low testing efficiency - Basic function verification can be completed locally, reducing cloud testing times
4. Difficult team collaboration - Unified build standards ensure consistency in output from different members
