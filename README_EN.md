## SDK Integration Guide

Before using the Bingo tool, you need to integrate [PlayableSDK.d.ts](./PlayableSDK.d.ts) into your project. This SDK provides the following main interfaces:

### Core Interfaces
1. `download()` - Call this method when the user clicks the download button
2. `game_end()` - Must be called when the game ends (whether win or lose)
3. `channel` - Get the current advertising channel (read-only property)

### Lifecycle Callback Interfaces
4. `onMute(callback)` - Register mute callback function
5. `onUnmute(callback)` - Register unmute callback function
6. `onPause(callback)` - Register pause callback function
7. `onResume(callback)` - Register resume callback function

### Basic Usage Example:

```typescript
try {
    PlayableSDK.download(); // Download button click event
    PlayableSDK.game_end(); // Call when the game ends
    
    // Get current advertising channel
    console.log('Current channel:', PlayableSDK.channel);
} catch (error) {
    console.warn(error);
}
```

### Lifecycle Management Example:

```typescript
// Register lifecycle callbacks
PlayableSDK.onMute(() => {
    // Mute game audio
    AudioManager.muteAll();
});

PlayableSDK.onUnmute(() => {
    // Unmute game audio
    AudioManager.unmuteAll();
});

PlayableSDK.onPause(() => {
    // Pause the game
    GameManager.pause();
});

PlayableSDK.onResume(() => {
    // Resume the game
    GameManager.resume();
});
```

## Important Configuration Notes

### Build Configuration Precautions

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice: When building your project with Cocos Creator, please make sure NOT to check the "MD5 Cache" option**

<img src="MD5_cache.png" alt="MD5 Cache Configuration" title="Do not check MD5 Cache option when building" width="60%">

Checking MD5 Cache can cause playable ads to malfunction on certain platforms because:
- MD5 caching changes the naming convention of resource files
- Some ad platforms have strict requirements for file names
- May cause resource loading failures or path errors

**Correct approach:** Ensure the "MD5 Cache" option remains unchecked in the build settings.

## What Problems Does It Solve for You?

1. Tedious platform adaptation - Different ad platforms have different SDK requirements, Bingo has built-in all adaptation code for you
2. Complex build process - From the original project to the final ad package, just a few clicks
3. Low testing efficiency - Basic function verification can be completed locally, reducing cloud testing times
4. Difficult team collaboration - Unified build standards ensure consistency in output from different members

## Use Cases

üéÆ Game Developers - Quickly create playable ads for your games to improve user conversion rates  
üì± Ad Agencies - Manage ad building needs for multiple client projects simultaneously  
üèÜ Indie Developers - No need to set up a complex environment, professional-grade ad development can be done on a personal computer
